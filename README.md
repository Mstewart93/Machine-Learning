# Machine Learning
 This is where I will store the code for all of my machine Learning projects and learning.

##Learning Log
 #Basic Set up information ( I use the terminal on my MacBook)
- I will be using mini conda. Once mini conda and a compatible version of Python is installed, you need to create the folder you want your enviroment in as well as what you want to be included.
  1. First cd (change directory) to where you want your folder to exist. I typically will put it in my github folder, might look like:
-  cd Documents/Github/Maching-Learning
  2. next you need to make the directory : mkdir Learning_Log
  3. cd to your Learning_Log folder
  3. conda create --prefix ./env (name of your enviroment) pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn jupyter (include all the tools you want in your enviroment, can always add later)
You can now activate your enviroment and run jupyter notebook.
